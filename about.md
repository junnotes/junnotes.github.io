Welcome to my blog!

I am a data science enthusiast with background in applied mathematics. In this blog, I plan to cover a range of topics related to data science, including machine learning, natural language processing, and data visualization. 

My goal is to share my experiences while also documenting my personal journey of growth and development in this field. I invite you to join me on this journey and explore the world through data together!
